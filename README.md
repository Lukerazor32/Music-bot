# Music-bot
Music bot is designed to receive songs depending on your mood. The administrator can populate the database with songs based on each mood he wants to add.
<br>
To fill one mood with songs, you need to select any song, on the basis of which the bot will find similar ones and fill the database with them
<br>
The bot uses parsing of two sites. The first one is used to get a list of similar songs, and the second one is used to download songs and send them to the user.
